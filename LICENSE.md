# VISION OF THE PROJECT:

PLANET EARTH DIGITAL JURISDICTION ( BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN )


INTERPLANETARY ID SYSTEM  - Planet Earth NFT Passports

Proof of Personhood 


# DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:


PoS ( proof of stake ) is inherently a plutocracy that makes the rich richer. I prefer democracy. Digital Democracy. 

ETH has no personhood, so you can't have 1 person = 1 vote. You can have 1 unit of money = 1 vote, which is plutocracy, not democracy.

ETH just blindly executes rules. The rules (that are effectively a monetary policy) are still written and approved by people, but these people aren't elected officials, but an oligarchy of developers and plutocracy of miners. And with Proof of Stake, the same happens with validators. POS is terrible. 

Anybody who has capital to do so<< can turn that capital into influence (through staking or mining). That is the definition of plutocracy. If it wasn't anyone, we'd be talking about aristocracy, etc.


BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN is the best invention ever since the internet.


Some core use cases:

- Land registry
