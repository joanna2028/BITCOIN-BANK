# PROBLEM 

ETHEREUM

→ Ethereum is left behind.

Proof of Stake is inherently a plutocracy that makes the rich richer.
I prefer democracy - Digital Democracy.

Ethereum Blockchain has NO personhood, so you can't have 1 person = 1 vote. 
You can have 1 unit of money = 1 vote, which is plutocracy, not democracy.

Ethereum Blockchain just blindly executes rules. 
The rules (that are effectively a monetary policy) are still written and approved by people, but these people aren't elected officials, but an oligarchy of developers and plutocracy of miners. And with Proof of Stake, the same happens with validators. POS is terrible.

Anybody who has capital to do so<< can turn that capital into influence (through staking or mining).That is the definition of plutocracy. If it wasn't anyone, we'd be talking about aristocracy..

Blockchain is the best invention ever since the internet. (It has existed for 13 years) -->Yes

But we have to move forward & fast → We don’t have time to waste → because of that I built →




# SOLUTION

BITCOIN 

(ethereum money supply and all crypto currencies will be converted into Bitcoin and allocated in INTERNET BANK, aka planetary DAO) same Bitcoin supply.


we allocate all cryptocurrencies on INTERNET BANK. ( Internet Bank will be X. condition: make X a DAO first.



Planetary DAO and its respective protocols. ( all on top of X )


* Global Taxation Protocol ( BITCOIN BANK ) i'm the founder
* Planetary ID wallets ( NOSTR )
* Interplanetary ID system - Global NFT Passports 


Global Government


Some core use cases of Planet Earth DAO ( X )

* Land registry
* Transparent gov spending
* Automated taxation Global Tax
* UBI

Some core use cases of Planet Earth NFT Passports

* Voting
* Taxation
* Border crossing
* Medical records

(or you could get a loan, or purchase a house, etc…  all you do in your Nation but worldwide)


Planetary ID wallets → Digital Identity Wallets  (  Decentralized Identity )

* Citizens
* Nations States
* Companies

We are building with ConsensYs

*A digital identity wallet enables a user to establish relationships and interact with third parties in a trusted manner. It is a piece of software, which helps you to stay in control of your messaging, security, health records, privacy, purchases etc…


“DECENTRALIZE IDENTITIES GIVES INDIVIDUALS CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN IDENTITY SO THAT THEY CAN DECIDE HOW THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SHARED AND ACCESSED, ENABLING TRUSTED INTERACTIONS WHILE PRESERVING PRIVACY.“

KEY words:  INDIVIDUALS CONTROL, ENABLING TRUSTED


 Data Integrity  prevent,

* Fake news
* Campaign disinformation
* Hacking database
* Hacking the voting software


We replace IMF with BITCOIN BANK. ( X BANK )
